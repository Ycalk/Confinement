# Welcome
Welcome to Confinement, a 3D game developed using MonoGame.

# About
Confinement is a turn-based puzzle game where your goal is to prevent the Red cubes from leaving the field. Youâ€™ll achieve this by strategically placing obstacles to block their path.

# How to Play
### Objective
Your goal is to stop the Red cubes from escaping the field by placing obstacles in their path.  

### Gameplay
1) The game is turn-based. At every step, you have the opportunity to place obstacles to block the Red cubes.
2) The field contains green cells. When a Red cube steps on a green cell, it will make a double move.

### Controls
Use the arrow keys or W, A, S, D to scale or rotate the field for a better view and strategic planning. The buttons on the side allow you to move around the cubes.

### Tips
1) Plan your moves carefully to ensure the Red cubes are effectively trapped.
2) Be mindful of the green cells, as they can cause the Red cubes to move faster and potentially escape your traps.
