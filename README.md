# Welcome
Welcome to Confinement, a 3D game developed using MonoGame.

# About
**Confinement** is a turn-based puzzle game where your goal is to prevent the Red cubes from leaving the field. You’ll achieve this by strategically placing obstacles to block their path.

# How to Play
### Objective
Your goal is to **stop the Red cubes** from escaping the field by placing obstacles in their path.  

### Gameplay
- The game is turn-based. At every step, you have the opportunity to **place obstacles** to block the Red cubes.
- The field contains green cells. When a Red cube steps on a green cell, it will make a double move.

### Controls
Use the arrow keys or W, A, S, D to scale or rotate the field for a better view and strategic planning. The buttons on the side allow you to move around the cubes.

### Tips
1) **Plan your moves** carefully to ensure the Red cubes are effectively trapped.
2) **Be mindful** of the green cells, as they can cause the Red cubes to move faster and potentially escape your traps.
